# ProductInventoryManagment
**Description:**

In this console-based application, I am  creating a basic inventory management system. This system  allows a user to manage a list of products, where each product has a name, price, and quantity in stock.

Here are the main functionalities the system  have:

1. **Add a product:** Prompt the user for the product name, price, and quantity, then add the product to the inventory. 
2. **View all products:** Display a list of all products in the inventory, along with their prices and quantities. 
3. **Edit a product:** Ask the user for a product name. If the product is in the inventory, allow the user to update its name, price, or quantity. 
4. **Delete a product:** Ask the user for a product name. If the product is in the inventory, remove it. 
5. **Search for a product:** Ask the user for a product name. If the product is in the inventory, display its name, price, and quantity. If not, let the user know the product was not found.
6. **Exit:** Close the application. *Final commit and push.*

For this project, I create a **`Product`** class with the appropriate properties (name, price, quantity) and methods.  an **`Inventory`** class which maintains a list of **`Product`** objects and provides methods for adding, deleting, and editing products.
